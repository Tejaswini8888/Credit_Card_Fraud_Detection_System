## 📊 Project Overview

A **production-ready end-to-end Machine Learning system** designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.

This project demonstrates the **complete ML lifecycle from data to deployment**:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ⚖ Handling severe class imbalance
- 🎯 Decision threshold optimization
- 🧠 Model training & evaluation
- 🚀 REST API development using FastAPI
- 🐳 Docker containerization
- ☁ Cloud deployment on Railway
- 🎨 Interactive frontend dashboard

## 🧠 Business Objective

Fraud detection is a **highly imbalanced classification problem**, where:

- ❌ False Negative → Fraud goes undetected → Financial loss  
- ❌ False Positive → Legitimate transaction blocked → Poor user experience  

### 🎯 Approach

The model is optimized for:

- ✅ **High Recall on Fraud Class** (to minimize missed frauds)  
- ⚖ Balanced Precision to reduce false alarms  

---

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric        | Value |
|--------------|------|
| Recall (Fraud) | ~0.93 |
| Precision (Fraud) | ~0.54 |
| ROC-AUC | ~0.95 |

### 🔍 Threshold Optimization
Default threshold (0.5) was adjusted to:


0.3


to improve fraud detection sensitivity.
